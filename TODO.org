* TODO rethink the averages
if this data is just getting sent to mqtt, then whatever is reading the data
from there can compute and store the averages, right?

i probably don't need to do any of that stuff in the weather station, although
i'll keep it in for now.

if i run into memory issues or bugs, i'll rip it all out

alternatively: control whether it gets computed or not via headers and ifdefs,
so that on larger brains it'll still work
