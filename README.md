SparkFun MicroMod Weather Carrier Board
=======================================

A PlatformIO library for interacting with the SparkFun MicroMod Weather Station
carrier board. 

Has support for the ESP32 MicroMod controller board.

# Why?

Mostly because I wanted some more experience writing C++ for micro-controllers,
but also to separate out the library in case it's useful for any one else.
